# Output from scripts
Key files generated by the various scripts, including statistsical analysis of the empirical data and simulations generated by the meta-ecosystem model  
* [disturbance_data_catchments.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/disturbance_data_catchment.csv): Disturbance metrics calculated from geospatial data at the catchment extent
* [disturbance_data_riparian.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/disturbance_data_riparian.csv): Disturbance metrics calculated from geospatial data at the riparian extent
* [disturbance_data_local.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/disturbance_data_local.csv): Disturbance metrics calculated from geospatial data at the local extent
* [empirical_glm_results.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/empirical_glm_results.csv): Results from comparing general linear models for each stream quality metric
* [empirical_stream_data.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/empirical_stream_data.csv): Mean values from the triplicate samples collected *in situ* at each stream site  
* [empirical_stream_data_standard_deviations.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/empirical_stream_data_standard_deviations.csv): Standard deviation of the triplicate samples collected *in situ* at each stream site to be paired with "empirical_stream_data.csv")
* [model_averaging_results.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/model_averaging_results.csv): Results from averaging models for each stream quality metric
* [param_simulations_stable.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/meta_ecosystem_model/blob/main/output/param_simulations_stable.csv): Equilibrium states for the metaecosystem using 10000 randomly generated sets of parameters, filtered for stability. The first 10000 equilibria are selected from this file and used as the initial state for the disturbance simulations.
