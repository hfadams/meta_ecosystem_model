# meta_ecosystem_model

The scripts in this repository are used to 1) clean and analyze empirical data collected from streams in Gros Morne National Park and Terra Nova National Park in Newfoundland, Canada and 2) simulate terrestrial disturbance in a meta-ecosystem model of these stream-riparian ecosystems. These files are inteded to make my analyses as transparent and reproducible as possible, and have the stream data openly accessible for further analysis. A thorough description of the collection methods can be found in the appendix of the associated thesis found in the MUN archives: [INSERT LINK WHEN AVAILABLE]. 

The land class data are not publically available, but Forest Resource Inventory shapefiles can be requested from the Newfoundland government, or can be digitized from satellite imagery.

## Data sources (need to fill this out with links or contact info?)
1) collected myself
2) data agreement with the parks
3) data agreement with the provincial government

## Methods
### In situ data
I collected the in situ data in triplicate at each stream site and took the mean of the three samples. I removed all data below the method detection limit of each analysis before further analysis. Refer to the main thesis text and appendix A for detailed methods.

### Model simulations
 

## software and packages
All data processing and analyses for this project were implemented using R (ver. 4.2.2), Mathematica (ver. 13.2.1), and QGIS (ver. 3.26.3).
